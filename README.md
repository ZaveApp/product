## Roadblocks

## Updates Assignment 10
- Despite having several time constriants with school work and exams, we have started to work more on the application more frequently by bringing what was once on the marvel-demo to XCode. initially we worked on making the app as basic as possible without the implementation of API's. (4/29/2019)
- Before finals week take a toll on our work on the application, we will start to put more effort in the creation of the application. There is still much more work to be done before this project is complete. (5/8/2019) 
- Before meeting again tomorrow, we will be working on how to implement Google Storage and Google Firebase into our application.(5/11/2019)
- Watched several videos on how toimplement Google Firebase and Google Storage into the user profile and the login page. This is an important part to make sure that all the people that are currently active on the account are visible to other accounts if they are going in the same direction. (5/12/2019)
- Countinuation of what we had planned to do last week
